# Sample Adoption of the Bounds Safety Extension in C

The Bounds Safety Extension (-fbounds-safety) is a language extension for C that enforces bounds safety to prevent out-of-bounds memory access. This repository provides sample and real-world code examples demonstrating how to adopt the extension, including how to enable it and add bounds annotations.

Please refer to the [Programming Model](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/BoundsSafety.html) and the [Adoption Guide](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/BoundsSafety.html) for a deeper understanding of the extension and practical steps for adoption.

For project-specific details, see the README files in the individual samples.
